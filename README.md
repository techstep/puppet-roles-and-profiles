# puppet-roles-and-profiles

This is a demonstration of the [roles and profiles pattern](http://www.craigdunn.org/2012/05/239/) for Puppet. By and large, this is just an pedagogical exercise so that I can get a better understanding of how it works, and how to structure nodes in a particular infrastructure.

Because it is designed as a skeleton, I have not included the appropriate modules from Puppet Forge.
